# JSON Data Structure

The JSON data consists of multiple lines, each containing information from a website. Each line follows the structure of a dictionary with a website link as the key and information from the website as the value.

## Example JSON Structure:

```json
[
    {"www.website1.com": "Scraped text from website 1."},
    {"www.website2.com": "Scraped text from website 2."},
    {"www.website3.com": "Scraped text from website 3."},
    ...
    {"www.websiteN.com": "Scraped text from website N."}
]
```

- **List**: `[...]`  
  - **Dictionary 1**: `{"www.website1.com": "Scraped text from website 1."}`
  - **Dictionary 2**: `{"www.website2.com": "Scraped text from website 2."}`
  - ...
  - **Dictionary N**: `{"www.websiteN.com": "Scraped text from website N."}`

Each dictionary represents data from a different website, with the key being the website link and the value being the information extracted from that website.

You would have multiple such dictionaries within the list, each corresponding to a different website's information.

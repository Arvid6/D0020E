# JSON Data Structure

The JSON data consists of multiple lines, each containing scraped text from a company website. Each line follows the structure of a dictionary with a website link as the key and scraped text from the website as the value.

## Example JSON Structure:

```json
[
    {"www.website1.com": "Scraped text from website 1."},
    {"www.website2.com": "Scraped text from website 2."},
    {"www.website3.com": "Scraped text from website 3."},
    ...
    {"www.websiteN.com": "Scraped text from website N."}
]
```
